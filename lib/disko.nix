    #
    # For redundancy>=1 (mirror or raidz):
    # All disks have ESP,ZFS,SWAP
    #
    # Partitions:
    # On a disk with ESP,ZFS,SWAP:
    #   1) EF02 partition: size 1M at start (only if explicitly shown in examples? 
    #      The examples show a EF02 partition for GRUB MBR: We'll follow examples literally.
    #   2) EF00 partition: size espSize after EF02
    #   3) ZFS partition: after ESP up to -swapSize
    #   4) SWAP partition: last partition with size swapSize
    #
    # On a disk with only ZFS:
    #   ZFS partition uses entire disk (no ESP or SWAP)
